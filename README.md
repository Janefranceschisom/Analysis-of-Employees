## INTRODUCTION

This task of data analysis was done using SQL. In this analysis, SQL was used to create a database and also solve some basic questions. I used postgreSQL to carry out the data analysis.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

To solve and provide solutions to the following problems and questions.

1. Select the employee table and show the data where the city is mumbai and delhi.
2. Select the employees table where the employee's first name have both 'a' and 'e' in them.
3. Subset the employee table to have te employees with a date of birth above 1990.
4. Subset the salary table to show salaries less than 1 million and sort it in ascending order.
5. Total number of employees in the employee table?
6. Top 5 cities with the highest number of employees,filter the result to show cities with more than 15 employees.
7. The most used pincode by the employee.


### Skills Demonstrated

1. Creation of databae
2. Creation of table
3. Select * FROM tablename
4. Insert into
5. Values
6. Where clause
7. Count(*)

## CONCLUSION

Getting to learn SQL with the functions hasnt been easy but with more consistence, i believe i will keep making a difference.
Understnding the basics of SQL which are

+ SELECT,FROM,INSERT INTO, VALUES,ALTER TABLE,ALTER COLUMNS.
+ Knowing the data type(integer,character, character varying ,identity/serial ,date, numeric,primary key,foreign key.
+ We have 7 employees who earn below 1million mark.
+ We have 14 employees who were born after 1990
+ We have 64 employees located where the city is mumbai and delhi.
+ We have total number of 100 employees in the company.
+ We have 3 cities with the highest number of employees above 15, they are mumbai with 44, delhi with 20 and pune with 16.
+ The pincode with the most usage with the employees is 410210.
